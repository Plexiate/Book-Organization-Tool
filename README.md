## My Example Shelf System

This is the system I use personally.

- `EA2-5`: East wall, Top row, 2nd shelf from left, 5th book
- `WB3-6`: West wall, Second from top, 3rd shelf from left, 6th book

Using the first example: 
E indicates the wall it's against, in this case it's the Eastern wall, A indicates top shelf, and 2 would be two from the left. The number after - is regarding it's position on the shelf 1-6.
